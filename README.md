# Hello-World-
This is my first repository.
I am 67 years old, venturing into the world of coding. I figured this is a most interesting, and I hope, a very rewarding use of my brain; to keep my mind sharp, and my spirit alive with new possibilities. Being able to look forward to new ideas and skills is a blessing for years to come.
I hope to find kindred souls of all ages in this camp.
Cheers!
